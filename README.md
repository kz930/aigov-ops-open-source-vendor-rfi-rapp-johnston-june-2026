# aigov-ops-open-source-vendor-rfi-rapp-johnston-june-2026

AIGovOps Foundation open-source Vendor RFI/RFP webapp — evidence-oriented vendor stack composer for Beacon & Umbrella, with auditor value model and neutral vendor sponsorship framework.

## Quick start

Open `index.html` (the overview) in a browser, then "Open webapp" to launch the advisor — or open
`vendor-rfi-advisor.html` directly.

## What this is

A static, two-page site in the AIGovOps "deep ocean governance" brand (shared with Beacon & Umbrella):

- **`index.html`** — the overview / landing page: what the RFI gives auditors and vendors, the
  Beacon · Umbrella · Lantern roadmap, and links into the app and docs.
- **`vendor-rfi-advisor.html`** — the advisor webapp. Two operating views:
  - **Beacon lens** — an unsigned evidence-receipt preview (canonical JSON + SHA-256), ready for
    Beacon Ed25519 + JCS signing.
  - **Umbrella lens** — a profile-driven stack composer across audit, policy-as-code, gates/controls,
    dashboards, runtime guardrails, and shipping code, with JSON/YAML export and a light/dark toggle.

The advisor's vendor data and recommendation logic are derived from `docs/vendor-guide.md`.

## Files
